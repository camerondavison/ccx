# Add ccx watch command

**Problem:** We had to repeatedly run `sleep 15 && ccx status ccx-5a358df8` to monitor progress. There's no way to watch a session until it completes or goes idle.

**Solution:** Add a `ccx watch <session>` command that continuously displays status until the session completes or user interrupts.

```
ccx watch ccx-5a358df8
ccx watch ccx-5a358df8 --interval 5  # check every 5 seconds (default: 2)
```

**Files:** `src/main.rs`, `src/tmux.rs`

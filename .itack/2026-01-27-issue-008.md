# Add working directory to ccx status output

## Problem

The `ccx status` command shows session name, status, and title but provides no indication of what directory each session is working in:

```
ccx-1434381e *done* [✳ Stack Issue 5]
ccx-db22529e *done* [✳ Status Indicators Implementation]
```

When running multiple sessions across different worktrees or projects, it's hard to know which session corresponds to which codebase.

## Desired Output

Show the working directory (or a meaningful suffix) at the end:

```
ccx-1434381e *done* [✳ Stack Issue 5] ~/Projects/myapp
ccx-db22529e *done* [✳ Status Indicators Implementation] Worktree/ccx-issue-5-wip
```

## Implementation Notes

Tmux provides the current pane directory via `#{pane_current_path}` format string. This can be retrieved alongside the pane title in `tmux.rs`.

Key files:
- `src/main.rs` - `cmd_status` function (lines 79-126)
- `src/tmux.rs` - tmux integration functions

Consider shortening paths (e.g., `~` for home, or just showing the last 2-3 path components) for readability.
